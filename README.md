Since **October 15, 2022** — after seeing many popular YouTubers and random tech bros having these *impressive personal websites*—I've dedicated myself to building my own. After **256+ commits**, 650 intermediate days of work, and *thousands of hours* of research, prototyping, building, and debugging, [ncp.dev](https://www.ncp.dev/) is officially released for all public viewing as of, **July 26, 2024**. 

The reason it took me so long was my **indecisiveness** about *myself* and *the users* that this website would be presented to. At first, it took a portfolio perspective, but later changed to more of a **personal website** than anything. Nonetheless, I was dedicated to a perfect first release, and [`KingPr0o7.github.io`](https://github.com/KingPr0o7/KingPr0o7.github.io) didn't live up to that standard. From there, I've improved and learned so many more things. Like e-mail communications, Astro, MDX, Vercel, and much better CSS and JS conceptual knowledge. 

Which brings us to today, where I've also built my own [personal brand](https://www.ncp.dev/branding), for the website and any other application or experience I make. I hope you enjoy my website, and if you do, please [let me know](https://www.ncp.dev/contact) or share to the word on social media. Hopefully, one day, I can see a YouTube video, tweet, blog, or podcast about how my website inspired or awed someone!
