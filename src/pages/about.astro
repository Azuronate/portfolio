	<p class="about-text">As a student and individual on a <b><i>continuous journey of curiosity</i></b> (<i>especially within computational computing</i>), I'm the type of person with a <b>drive to constantly learn</b> from the world around me. With <b>any</b> bit of leisure time, I'll <i>most likely</i> allocate it towards <b>school work</b> and <b>programming my future</b>. I'm your typical computer geek with a <b>passion</b> for <i>making things work for other people</i>; seeing those people enjoy the end-product <b>fuels this intense passion</b>. So much so, that I quit playing baseball and dedicated my time to <b>creating things with code</b>. Nowadays, <i>even video games</i> have faded from my activities, to be transferred into learning and writing better programs.</p>
	<p class="about-text">To fulfill my <b>love</b> for computers, I accepted a pathway in <b>Software Development</b> that <b>targeted</b> and <b>deepened</b> my passion in pursuing the field as a dream job. <b>But</b>, I didn't randomly say one day <i>“oh I'm going to do that”</i> — a series of events had to occur before that conclusion was made back in 2021. That's where my father comes into the story, starting me off with consoles he grew up with and allowing me to <b>explore</b> and <b>expand</b> my curiosity as I grew: </p>
	<Timeline />
	<p class="about-text">Upon building such software, there is a <b>lot</b> that goes into the process. Even with small-scoped projects, I can <b>never</b> find the <b><i>“good enough”</i></b> balance to <b>satisfy</b> my wants for <i>my users</i> and <i>myself</i>. This is <b>apparent</b> when I look back on old software that I write, and is almost like the <b>driving force</b> towards the projects/software that I build. Even with teachers <b>reiterating</b> the fact, “you have to accept when a project is good enough, and just satisfies the needs required” is a common saying I can't seem to <b>settle</b> with. Another thing is the acceptance of <b>failure</b>, every time I tackle a new project, I'm always <i>going into the depths of the unknown</i>. <b>Failure</b> is a <b>key</b> part of what I do, and learning how to <i>tackle, accept, and learn</i> from such failures is what <b>drives</b> me into <b>loving</b> software development.</p>	
	<p class="about-text">Now, some developers go the self-taught route (<i>usually because of a multitude of reasons</i>) but I'm someone who <b>loves</b> the aspect of learning in a classroom environment with <b>comprehensible projects</b> to present my <b>understanding and knowledge building</b>. I know <i>not every course is structured as so</i>; <i>however</i>, I'm <b>committed</b> to going to a four-year-college to study a branch of computer science, <i>and thus</i>, these are the scholarly steps I've taken: </p>

	<FAQ>
		<Question question="What's this site's purpose?">
			<p slot="answer" class="answer-text">This site's purpose is like my own <i>little GitHub</i> — not meant to be <i>taken seriously</i>. In an ideal world, <b>first</b> would come my resume, then my site to show all my work and <b>passion</b> for what I do. My site is <b>thousands of hours</b> of <i>research, building, testing, and failing to make something</i>, even if it gets no <b>public interaction</b>. <i>I'm not here for views</i> — <b>I'm here to make something</b>.</p>
		</Question>
		<Question question="What is the meaning/origin of 'KingPr0o7?'">
			<p slot="answer" class="answer-text">KingPr0o7, pronounced — / <a href="http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=k%C9%AA%C5%8Bpro%CA%8A%20o%CA%8A%20%CB%88s%C9%9Bv%C9%99n&voice=Joey" class="link">kɪŋproʊ oʊ ˈsɛvən</a> / was a handle for my Fortnite account back on <i>May 26, 2018</i>, and became my <b><i>go-to</i></b> handle for the internet. I wanted it to start with “King,” then my father added “Pro” because he thought it would <i>suit and sound pretty nice</i>. The rest was because “KingPro” was taken, so extras were added: <i>birth year</i> and <i>variation</i> to get a unique one. I find it funny when streamers stop for a second to process how to go about its pronunciation and often say “King Pr- Zero <i>Oh</i> Seven,” but <i>other than that</i>, my handle has <b>no</b> hidden meaning <b>unless added otherwise</b>.</p>
		</Question>
		<Question question="Who inspires you?">
			<p slot="answer" class="answer-text">Other than the people <i>I see most often</i>, like <i>my teachers and parents</i>, the one person who always seems to <b>inspire</b> me is an <i>online streamer and content creator</i>, <a href="https://twitter.com/t3dotgg" class="link">@Theo</a>. Aside from the common ground of programming, he has, <b><i>time and time again</i></b>, inspired me to keep working hard <b>while</b> showing the vast world I have been trying to get into. He has also <b>built</b> a like-minded community that has sustained to keep me <b>loving</b> what I do. <br><br>Other people that inspire me: <a href="https://twitter.com/ThePrimeagen" class="link">@ThePrimeagen</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/juxtopposed" class="link">@juxtopposed</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD" class="link">@MKBHD</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/fireship_dev" class="link">@fireship_dev</a>, and <b>more</b>...</p>
		</Question>
		<Question question="Are you the type of guy to hack my Wi-Fi / fix my printer?">
			<p slot="answer" class="answer-text">It's true that I'm interested in <b>all forms of technology</b>, <i>but</i> the world of IoT is a subset of technology I choose <b>not to further my interest in</b>. While I have '<i>hacked</i>' my school's staff Wi-Fi network; <b><i>several times</i></b>, and have been known to fix printers, that's just something <b>I don't want to be known for</b>. <i>However</i>, starting out in IT has been a <b>great way</b> to build my knowledge as from my time volunteering for my school's IT department!</p>
		</Question>
		<Question question="What's up with your writing style?">
			<p slot="answer" class="answer-text">When I write, my main goal is <b>expression</b> and <i>informing people</i> like <b><i><u>you</u></i></b>. <i>However</i>, usually, I can't convey the <b>desired</b> amount of expression via my writing. <i>So</i>, I deploy <b><i>emphasized text highlighting</i></b> to convey <i>meaning</i> and <b>importance</b> without the use of emojis. <br><br><i>Moreover</i>, some teachers and others have started to point out my writing style sounds “<i>robotic, bland, or too advanced</i>” which has puzzled me for quite some time.  I <b>never will</b> and <b>never have</b> used large language models to make my work, and yet teachers <i>accuse me as such</i>. Since the start of these accusations, I've been trying to improve my tone to combat and flavor my writing.</p>
		</Question>
		<Question question="How can I support you?">
			<p slot="answer" class="answer-text"><b>Thank you</b> for your interest in me, I'm just a kid <b>chasing his dream</b>, and <b>just viewing my work</b> on <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/KingPr0o7">X</a> and my site fuels me <b>tenfold</b>. <i>However</i>, if you want to <b>extend</b> your support, consider being a <a class="link" href="https://github.com/sponsors/KingPr0o7?frequency=recurring&sponsor=KingPr0o7">GitHub Sponsor</a>! It allows for <b>multiple donation amounts</b> to fit what you think I deserve! All earnings <b>go straight towards my degree in computer science</b> (<i>gotta pay that student loan somehow</i>)! <br><br>And <i>if you're reading this</i>, I would like to say <b>thank you</b>. People <b><i><u>like you</u></i></b>, I cherish <b>every</b> — <b>single</b> — <b>day</b>. All support <b>fuels my dream</b> in becoming a software developer.
