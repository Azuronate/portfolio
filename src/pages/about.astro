		<p class="prologue-text">As a student and individual on a continuous journey of curiosity (especially within computational computing), I'm the type of person with a drive to constantly learn from the world around me. With any bit of leisure time, I'll most likely allocate it towards school work and programming my future. I'm your typical computer geek with a sweet spot for making things work for other people; the feeling of satisfaction of solving people's issues within technology skyrockets above anything else. So much so, that I quit playing baseball and dedicated my time to creating things with code. Nowadays, even video games have faded from my activities, to be transferred into writing websites.</p>
		<p class="prologue-text">To fulfill my love for computers, I accepted a pathway in ‚ÄúSoftware Development‚Äù that targeted and deepened my passion in pursuing the field as a dream job. But, I didn't randomly say one day ‚Äúoh I'm going to do that‚Äù¬†‚Äî a series of events had to occur before that conclusion was made back in 2020. That's where my father comes into the story, starting me off with consoles he grew up with and allowing me to explore and expand my curiosity as I grew. Below is a timeline of my exploration through computers, concepts, and love for learning.</p>

			<h1 id="background-header">Hello! I'm Nathan Parker,</h1>
			<p class="about-text">An <b>undergraduate</b> at <a class="link" href="https://www.ivytech.edu/about-ivy-tech/">Ivy Tech</a> via my high school's early college program, currently specializing in <i>web, game, and database technologies</i>. And <b>constantly</b> building new technological projects from <i>websites, games, or Minecraft servers</i>.</p>

			<p class="about-text">My <b>love</b> of technology derived in mid-2012 when my father introduced me to game consoles like the <i>Nintendo Entertainment System, GameCube, and the Wii</i>. Then, after a few years, I moved on to Windows 7 laptops and a range of Apple devices around 2015. Always constantly <i>tinkering, improving, creating, <b>or</b> finding vulnerabilities in schools' technological infrastructure</i> üòÖ.</p>

			<p class="about-text"><i>In 2018</i>, I first found my love of programming by joining my local <a class="link" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> club at my local library. I built many small games and enjoyed seeing something come to life just with a few blocks. From then on, I learned more programming via Minecraft server development with <a class="link" href="https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript">SkriptLang</a> and website development via high school Computer Science courses. Nowadays, I'm learning more advanced programming with <i>Python, JavaScript, and soon-to-be C#</i>.</p>

		<h2 class="about-header">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		<FAQ>
			<Question question="What's this site's purpose?">
				<p slot="answer" class="answer-text">This site's purpose is like my own little GitHub ‚Äî not meant to be taken seriously. In an ideal world, first would come my resume, then my site to show all my work and passion for what I do. My site is thousands of hours of research, building, testing, and failing to make something, even if it gets no public interaction. I'm not here for views ‚Äî I'm here to make something.</p>
			</Question>
			<Question question="What is the meaning/origin of 'KingPr0o7?'">
				<p slot="answer" class="answer-text">KingPr0o7, pronounced ‚Äî / <a href="http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=k%C9%AA%C5%8Bpro%CA%8A%20o%CA%8A%20%CB%88s%C9%9Bv%C9%99n&voice=Joey" class="link">k…™≈ãpro ä o ä Ààs…õv…ôn</a> / was a handle for my Fortnite account back on May 26, 2018, and became my go-to handle for the internet. I wanted it to start with "King," then my father added "Pro" because he thought it would suit and sound pretty nice. The rest was because "KingPro" was taken, so extras were added: birth year and variation to get a unique one. I find it funny when streamers stop for a second to process how to go about its pronunciation and often say "King Pr- Zero Oh Seven," but other than that, my handle has no hidden meaning unless added otherwise.</p>
			</Question>
			<Question question="Who inspires you?">
				<p slot="answer" class="answer-text">Other than the people I see most often, like <i>my teachers and parents</i>, the one person who always seems to <b>inspire</b> me is an <i>online streamer and content creator</i>, <a href="https://twitter.com/t3dotgg" class="link">@Theo</a>. Aside from the common ground of programming, he has, <b><i>time and time again</i></b>, inspired me to keep working hard <b>while</b> showing the vast world I have been trying to get into. He has also <b>built</b> a like-minded community that has sustained to keep me <b>loving</b> what I do. <br><br>Other people that inspire me: <a href="https://twitter.com/ThePrimeagen" class="link">@ThePrimeagen</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/juxtopposed" class="link">@juxtopposed</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD" class="link">@MKBHD</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/fireship_dev" class="link">@fireship_dev</a>, and <b>more</b>...</p>
			</Question>
			<Question question="Your writing ‚Äî why so advanced?">
				<p slot="answer" class="answer-text">My writing is "advanced" because of the countless English papers and classes that I've taken. As thus such, I've developed to write how I would as an English paper, in most cases, even tweeting. I also try to improve my vocabulary whenever I can to further my writing. It's just something I enjoy doing and continue to this day. </p>
