			<h1 id="about-header">Hello! I'm Nathan Parker,</h1>
			<p class="about-text">An <b>undergraduate</b> at <a class="link" href="https://www.ivytech.edu/about-ivy-tech/">Ivy Tech</a> via my high school's early college program, currently specializing in <i>web, game, and database technologies</i>. And <b>constantly</b> building new technological projects from <i>websites, games, or Minecraft servers</i>.</p>

			<p class="about-text">My <b>love</b> of technology derived in mid-2012 when my father introduced me to game consoles like the <i>Nintendo Entertainment System, GameCube, and the Wii</i>. Then, after a few years, I moved on to Windows 7 laptops and a range of Apple devices around 2015. Always constantly <i>tinkering, improving, creating, <b>or</b> finding vulnerabilities in schools' technological infrastructure</i> ðŸ˜….</p>

			<p class="about-text"><i>In 2018</i>, I first found my love of programming by joining my local <a class="link" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> club at my local library. I built many small games and enjoyed seeing something come to life just with a few blocks. From then on, I learned more programming via Minecraft server development with <a class="link" href="https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript">SkriptLang</a> and website development via high school Computer Science courses. Nowadays, I'm learning more advanced programming with <i>Python, JavaScript, and soon-to-be C#</i>.</p>
