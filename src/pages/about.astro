	<p class="about-text">As a student and individual on a continuous journey of curiosity (especially within computational computing), I'm the type of person with a drive to constantly learn from the world around me. With any bit of leisure time, I'll most likely allocate it towards school work and programming my future. I'm your typical computer geek with a sweet spot for making things work for other people; the feeling of satisfaction of solving people's issues within technology skyrockets above anything else. So much so, that I quit playing baseball and dedicated my time to creating things with code. Nowadays, even video games have faded from my activities, to be transferred into writing websites.</p>
	<p class="about-text">To fulfill my love for computers, I accepted a pathway in “Software Development” that targeted and deepened my passion in pursuing the field as a dream job. But, I didn't randomly say one day “oh I'm going to do that” — a series of events had to occur before that conclusion was made back in 2020. That's where my father comes into the story, starting me off with consoles he grew up with and allowing me to explore and expand my curiosity as I grew. Below is a timeline of my exploration through computers, concepts, and love for learning.</p>
	<Timeline />
	<p class="about-text">Upon building such software, there is a lot that goes into the process. Even with small-scoped projects, I can never find the “good enough” balance to satisfy my wants for my users and myself. This is apparent when I look back on old software that I write, and is almost like the driving force towards the projects/software that I build. Even with teachers reiterating the fact, “you have to accept when a project is good enough, and just satisfies the needs required” is a common saying I can't seem to settle with. Another thing is the acceptance of failure, every time I tackle a new project, I'm always going into the depths of the unknown. Failure is a key part of what I do, and learning how to tackle, accept, and learn from such failures is what drives me into loving software development.</p>

		<FAQ>
			<Question question="What's this site's purpose?">
				<p slot="answer" class="answer-text">This site's purpose is like my own little GitHub — not meant to be taken seriously. In an ideal world, first would come my resume, then my site to show all my work and passion for what I do. My site is thousands of hours of research, building, testing, and failing to make something, even if it gets no public interaction. I'm not here for views — I'm here to make something.</p>
			</Question>
			<Question question="What is the meaning/origin of 'KingPr0o7?'">
				<p slot="answer" class="answer-text">KingPr0o7, pronounced — / <a href="http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=k%C9%AA%C5%8Bpro%CA%8A%20o%CA%8A%20%CB%88s%C9%9Bv%C9%99n&voice=Joey" class="link">kɪŋproʊ oʊ ˈsɛvən</a> / was a handle for my Fortnite account back on May 26, 2018, and became my go-to handle for the internet. I wanted it to start with "King," then my father added "Pro" because he thought it would suit and sound pretty nice. The rest was because "KingPro" was taken, so extras were added: birth year and variation to get a unique one. I find it funny when streamers stop for a second to process how to go about its pronunciation and often say "King Pr- Zero Oh Seven," but other than that, my handle has no hidden meaning unless added otherwise.</p>
			</Question>
			<Question question="Who inspires you?">
				<p slot="answer" class="answer-text">Other than the people I see most often, like <i>my teachers and parents</i>, the one person who always seems to <b>inspire</b> me is an <i>online streamer and content creator</i>, <a href="https://twitter.com/t3dotgg" class="link">@Theo</a>. Aside from the common ground of programming, he has, <b><i>time and time again</i></b>, inspired me to keep working hard <b>while</b> showing the vast world I have been trying to get into. He has also <b>built</b> a like-minded community that has sustained to keep me <b>loving</b> what I do. <br><br>Other people that inspire me: <a href="https://twitter.com/ThePrimeagen" class="link">@ThePrimeagen</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/juxtopposed" class="link">@juxtopposed</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD" class="link">@MKBHD</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/fireship_dev" class="link">@fireship_dev</a>, and <b>more</b>...</p>
